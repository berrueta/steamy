        <h2>What is STEAMY?</h2>

        <p>
          Free software community is constantly populating tons of information
          about several aspects of its nature. This information lacks an
          uniform representation format what makes impossible for machines to
          understand it and, most importantly, to link it together.
          But when everything seemed lost, <a href="http://semanticweb.org/">Semantic Web</a> 
          came in rescue!
        </p>

        <p>
         The aim of STEAMY is to enumerate, discover, represent, mine and link
         free software community data sources. In short, we'd like to add as many 
         bubbles at <a href=" http://linkeddata.org/">Linkeddata.org</a> as possible. 
        </p>

        <p>
          STEAMY would also like to act as a meeting point for people working
          worldwide on applied semantic technologies. As we don't like to
          reinvent the wheel, we'd like to know from people working on related
          stuff. In case you were working on something that could fit here,
          we will be pleased to hear from you and try to join our efforts, everybody 
          wants a more meaninful web!

        <p>
          Information will be modeled using ontologies, represented through RDF and 
          queried via SPARQL.
        </p>

        <p>
          Software products will be hosted in a 
          <a href="http://github.com/nbarrientos/steamy/">public GIT repository</a>
          and published under the terms of the MIT software license.

        <h2>Achivements</h2>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, STEAMY has just started and we haven't much to show up to now.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the moment we're trying to identify data sources and discovering
          what work is already being done.

        <p>
          STEAMY is a very wide project, it covers a big set of data sources
          therefore any help is much appreciated. Either if you're developing 
          ontologies, building rdfizers, or just wanting to help the free 
          software community somehow you're welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't think about it, just drop a mail to <a href="#nbarrientos">Nacho Barrientos</a>
          with few lines about your projects, ideas, results, rants...
